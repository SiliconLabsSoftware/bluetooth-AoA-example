/*
 * \brief
 *   Wrapper function for getting random data from the TRNG.
 *
 * \details
 *   Even though it is declared with a static scope, a function pointer to this
 *   function will be exposed so that it is indirectly usable for other
 *   compilation units as well.
 *
 * \note
 *   This function does not assume any responsibility to aquire and release
 *   ownership of the CRYPTOACC peripheral.
 *
 * \warning
 *   This function is called from contexts where it is not possible to return an
 *   error code. Any errors are therefore handled by resetting the system. This
 *   is deemed appropriate since a failed randomness generation may have severe
 *   security implications.
