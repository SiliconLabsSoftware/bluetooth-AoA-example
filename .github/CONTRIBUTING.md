# Contribution Guide for Open Source Developers

## Introduction
Welcome to a Silicon Labs open source project! We are excited to have you contribute. This guide will help you understand how to get started, the process for contributing, and the rules you need to follow.

## Getting Started
1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.  
[GitHub Forking Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
   
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone`.  
[GitHub cloning Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

## Creating an Issue
Before you start working on a new feature or bug fix, you need to create a GitHub issue. This helps us keep track of what is being worked on and ensures that multiple people are not working on the same thing.

1. **Check for Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, check if there is already an issue for the same topic.
2. 
3. **Create a New Issue**: If no existing issue is found, create a new issue with a detailed description of the problem or feature request.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
All contributors must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before their contributions can be accepted. This ensures that the project can legally use the contributions.
CLA signage is covered with an github workflow. You will be asked to give email-address and company name (if it is a business account).

## Making Changes
1. **Create a Branch**: Create a branch based on the issue what you just created.
2. **Make Your Changes**: Make the necessary changes in your local repository.
3. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message using `git commit -m "Description of changes"`.

## Submitting a Pull Request
1. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your forked repository using `git push origin branch-name`.
2. **Open a Pull Request**: Navigate to the original repository and open a pull request from your forked repository. Ensure that you link the pull request to the relevant issue.

## Code Review
1. **Review Process**: Your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers. They may request changes or provide feedback.
2. **Make Requested Changes**: If changes are requested, make the necessary updates and push them to your branch. The pull request will be updated automatically.

## Merging
Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch by a project maintainer.

## Additional Guidelines
- **Code of Conduct**: Follow the project's code of conduct to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.
- **Documentation**: Update the documentation if your changes affect any part of it.
- **Testing**: Ensure that your changes are well-tested and do not break existing functionality.

## Support
If you have any questions or need help, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers or open an issue for support.
